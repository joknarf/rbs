reverse interactive command server over ssh

## usage

* Bypass any totally useless/buggy security tools protection auditing your tty, like CyberArk CAC, that is wrongly injecting bad Ctl-C to your tty, as they are totally unable to parse the command you are executing.

* Advice: Never use in this in your enterperise
